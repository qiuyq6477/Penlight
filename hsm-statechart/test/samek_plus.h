/**
 * @file samek_plus.h
 *
 * Define a sequence of events and states for the samek's example statemachine from page 95 of Practical Statecharts.
 *
 * A limitation of samek's original test is that there are no leaf states that are also siblings. 
 * That means there are no transitions where the source of the transition is higher than the lca of current and target.
 * This test, therefore, adds state s12 and event 'i'. 
 *
 * When current is 's11', and 'i' fires, 's0' becomes the source of a transition to 's12'.
 * The lca of current and target will be s1, and -- while normally that's important -- 
 * based on the spec, since source is *higher* than lca, we expect the 'lca' to be ignored. 
 * We expect to exit all the way up to the source 's0', then init down into 's12'.
